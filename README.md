# Shopping-Cart


#### I worked on the Shopping Cart task, where I built a web application using React, Redux, and Bootstrap to provide a seamless shopping experience. The application allows users to browse products, view details, adjust quantities, and persist cart data using localStorage to ensure items remain saved after a page refresh. ðŸš€
